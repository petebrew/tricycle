It is split into two sections:
            Reader config and Writer config. </p><div class="section" title="Character sets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e198"></a>Character sets</h2></div></div></div><p> The character set can be set for both the file being read and the file being
                written. The character set is the system for pairing computer character codes with
                the character glyphes that we read. The widely used standard was originally ASCII,
                but this does not include diacritic characters, and characters specific to certain
                languages. There have since been many character encodings proposed (e.g ISO 8859-1
                for Western Europe and ISO 8859-7 for Greece) as well as some that are specific to
                Windows and Mac operating systems (e.g. Windows-1252 and MacRoman). The character
                set this is becoming most widely used is the Unicode UTF-8. This is capable of
                representing all 107,000+ distinct characters while remaining backwards compatible
                with ASCII for the 128 characters that it ASCII is able to represent. </p><p> If an incorrect character encoding is used to interpret a file, normally the
                majority of characters will display correctly (where the character sets share the
                same encodings) but more unusual characters will be displayed incorrectly -
                typically square boxes or question marks. </p><p> TRiCYCLE can using the NIO package to attempt to automatically detect which
                encoding a file is in. Unfortunately, there is no full-proof way to do this so by
                default, this feature is turned off. If you are having problems with character
                encodings you may like to choose 'Automatic' in the charset box if you have no idea
                what character encoding your file is in. </p><p> The character encoding is set to the default for the operating system you are
                running. For instance on MacOSX this will be MacRoman and for Windows it will be
                Windows-1250. If you know your input file is in a different encoding you should set
                it in the input charset box. If your output file needs to be read on an operating
                system other than the one you are currently running, then you may like to override
                the writer charset. Please note that for certain writers the character set used is
                part of the file specification (e.g. TRiDaS must be UTF-8). In this case your choice
                will be ignored. </p><p> The final complication with regards character sets is the line feed character(s).
                For historical reasons different operating systems use different characters to
                represent a new line. Depending on the software that is used to read a file, this
                can cause problems. TRiCYCLE itself will automatically adapt to files with any type
                of line feed characters so reading files in TRiCYCLE will never be a problem. When
                writing out files, TRiCYCLE will use the default line feed for the operating system
                you are running on unless you choose a platform specific character set. For instance
                if you run TRiCYCLE on Windows and choose a MacRoman writing charset, TRiCYCLE will
                use Mac style line feeds. </p></div></div></body></html>
