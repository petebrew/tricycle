TRiCYCLE extracts both data and any metadata present in files and converts them to the Tree-Ring Data
Standard (TRiDaS) data model. As TRiDaS is capable of representing the full range of dendro data and
metadata, it is then possible to write out the file to any one of the supported formats.
Key features of TRiCYCLE are:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Seamless support for units where possible
 \item Interpretation of all metadata
 \item Handling of different character sets and line feeds from different operating systems
 \item Comprehensive warning and exception system which provides detailed feedback when errors are
detected in files
\end{itemize*}


For a complete discussion of TRiCYCLE and its underlying libraries please see \citep{tricycle}.


\chapter{Installation}

TRiCYCLE is a Java application and so can be installed on any modern operating system. To make
installation more familiar though we have packaged it up into native installers for Windows, Mac OSX
and Linux. Download the relevant package for your operating system from the SourceForge \url{http://
tridas.sf.net} website.

\begin{description}
 \item[Windows] - Run the setup program and follow the steps. The program will be installed to your hard disk
and shortcuts added to your start menu. If you do not have Java installed on your system or
you do not have the required version the installer will provide you with assistance to do so.
 \item[Mac OSX] - Open the .dmg file in Finder. Drag the TRiCYCLE.app file into your Applications folder, or
wherever you'd like it installed. MacOSX comes pre-installed with Java so there is no need
to install it separately.
 \item[Linux] - An Ubuntu deb package is provided for TRiCYCLE. Install this package with your standard
package manager (e.g. sudo dpkg --install TRiCYCLE\_X.X.deb). It includes information
on the required dependencies therefore it should install everything you need if you are
running Ubuntu. On other distributions you may find that the dependencies do not install
automatically and the TRiCYCLE installation fails. If this is the case you will have to install
sun-java6-jre first manually.
\end{description}


\chapter{How to use TRiCYCLE}

The first step is to specify the format of your input file(s). Choose your input file format from the pull
down list on the File List page.  If you are uncertain what format your file is in, you can use Identify file format option in the help menu. Due to the fact that some formats are very similar, Corina may suggest the file is one of several formats.  If this is the case you will need to either check the file format descriptions in the appendices, or try each format in turn.

The next stage is to specify the file(s) that you would like to convert. This
can be done in a variety of ways:

\begin{itemize*}
 \item Click the browse button
 \item Use the \verb|File > Open| menu
 \item Drag files onto the dialog box from your file manager (e.g. Finder on MacOSX, My Computer on
Windows or Nautilus, Dolphin, Konqueror etc on Linux).
\end{itemize*}

Once you have your list of files prepared you can then go to the Convert tab.

On the Convert page, the next thing you need to do is select the desired output format from the drop down
list. Next, press the convert button and after a short delay your files should appear in the list below. At the
bottom of the window, you'll see a summary showing how many files were processed, how many of the
conversions failed and how many were converted successfully but with warnings.


The results of the conversion are shown in a tree view on the convert tab. Files that failed to convert are
highlighted by a red cross along with a message explaining what went wrong. Each file that converted
successfully and with no warnings is shown with a green tick icon below which are shown the output file
or files. Depending on the input and output formats chosen, a input file may be converted into one or more
output files as some formats can store just one series while others can store multiple series.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{screenshot1.png}
\caption{Screen shot showing the conversion of three TRiDaS files into Sheffield
format. The second and third files both include warnings that the Sheffield format
is unable to fully represent all the data in the input files.} 
\label{fig:screenshot}
\end{figure}

If there were warnings produced during the conversion process, then the file will be marked with a orange
exclamation icon. Warnings can be associated with either the process of reading the input file, or writing
the output file. They can also be related to a single series within the file or the input file as a whole. The
warning messages are displayed to illustrate the context of the warning. Longer warnings will scroll of the
edge of the window, but if you hover your mouse over the warning a tool-tip will show the entire message.

If you would like to preview the result of the conversion process you can double click on the output files
and they will be displayed in a text viewer. This option is not, however, available for binary formats such
as CATRAS and Excel.

Once you are happy with the results of the conversion you can save the files permanently to disk by pressing
the save button. It will offer you the option of specifying which folder to save the files to.


\chapter{Options}

The options panel is available from the file menu. It is split into two sections: Reader config and Writer
config.

\section{Character sets}

The character set can be set for both the file being read and the file being written. The character set is
the system for pairing computer character codes with the character glyphs that we read. The widely
used standard was originally ASCII, but this does not include diacritic characters, and characters specific
to certain languages. There have since been many character encodings proposed (e.g ISO 8859-1 for
Western Europe and ISO 8859-7 for Greece) as well as some that are specific to Windows and Mac
operating systems (e.g. Windows-1252 and MacRoman). The character set that is becoming most widely
used is Unicode UTF-8. This is capable of representing all 107,000+ distinct characters while remaining
backwards compatible with ASCII for the 128 characters that it is able to represent.

If an incorrect character encoding is used to interpret a file, normally the majority of characters will display
correctly (where the character sets share the same encodings) but more unusual characters will be displayed
incorrectly - typically square boxes or question marks.

TRiCYCLE can using the NIO package to attempt to automatically detect which encoding a file is in.
Unfortunately, there is no full-proof way to do this, so by default, this feature is turned off. If you are
having problems with character encodings you may like to choose 'Automatic' in the charset box if you
have no idea what character encoding your file is in.

The character encoding is set to the default for the operating system you are running. For instance on
MacOSX this will be MacRoman and for Windows it will be Windows-1250. If you know your input file
is in a different encoding you should set it in the input charset box. If your output file needs to be read
on an operating system other than the one you are currently running, then you may like to override the
writer charset. Please note that for certain writers, the character set used is part of the file specification
(e.g. TRiDaS must be UTF-8). In this case your choice will be ignored.

The final complication with regards character sets is the line feed character(s). For historical reasons
different operating systems use different characters to represent a new line. Depending on the software
that is used to read a file, this can cause problems. TRiCYCLE itself will automatically adapt to files with
any type of line feed characters so reading files in TRiCYCLE will never be a problem. When writing
out files, TRiCYCLE will use the default line feed for the operating system you are running, unless you
choose a platform specific character set. For instance if you run TRiCYCLE on Windows and choose a
MacRoman writing charset, TRiCYCLE will use Mac style line feeds.


\section{Metadata editor}

TRiCYCLE works by reading in a data file and translating it into the TRiDaS data model. TRiDaS has
a rich array of fields to represent all manner of dendro data and metadata. Although most of these are
optional, the TRiDaS specification requires that a handful of these are always filled in. Unfortunately many
of the legacy data formats do not contain information for these mandatory fields, therefore TRiCYCLE
must fill these with default values. You will most commonly see these defaults as 'Unnamed object' etc in
your output file. The metadata editor enables you to override these default values.

Clicking on the reader metadata editor button in the options window will give a table of all the metadata
fields that will be set automatically by TRiCYCLE along with their current values. You can change most
of these with the exception of those that are required to be a controlled vocabulary. These will require a 
more complicated interface which we haven't had time to implement yet. The third column in the editor is
a tick box to specify whether the value is overriding or not. If ticked, the value specified in this editor will
be used regardless of whether a value can be extracted by TRiCYCLE from the input data files.

An identical editor is available for the writer. These are the default values used by the writer code for
your chosen output format. For instance, TRiDaS does not require that a start year field be set (as in the
case of relatively dated series), whereas some output formats do require such a field. If an input file does
not contain start year information then some writers need to know which default value for start year to
use. Like for the input metadata editor, you can set fields to `overriding' which means they will be used
regardless of whether this information is available in the input dataset.

\section{Naming convention}

Some file formats can contain just one data series while others can contain many. When converting from
a multi-series format to a single series format this means that one input file is converted to multiple output
files. The naming convention is used to determine how to name the output files. The naming convention
relates to the filename itself and not the file extension. The file extension is specific to the output format
chosen (e.g. Heidelberg files are .fh and TRiDaS files are .xml).

\begin{description}
 \item[Numerical] - This is the default naming convention. It uses the name of the input data file and
appends an incrementing number if more than one output file is produced.
 \item[UUID] - This gives all output files a random named based on Universally Unique Identifiers
(UUIDs). This is a 36 character hexadecimal code which due to the astronomically
large number of possible combinations is guaranteed to be universally unique. A
typical filename will look like: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.
 \item[Hierarchical] - This uses the hierarchical structure of the TRiDaS data model to provide a meaningful
name for the output file. It joins together the title of each entity in the file beginning
with the project name through to the series name. For files that contain multiple series,
the name will contain details of all the entities shared by all the series in the file. For
example, if a file contains several series from the same sample, then the file name
will be projectTitle-objectTitle-elementTitle-sampleTitle. If the file contains several
series from different samples of the same object, then the file would be projectTitle-
objectTitle. If multiple output files end up with the same name then like the numerical
convention described above, the files will have an incremental number appended to
the end. Unfortunately, most input data files do not contain rich name information
so files end up being called unnamedProject-unnamedObject-unnamedElement etc.
This convention is therefore more appropriate when converting from TRiDaS to other
formats.
 \end{description}

\section{Privacy options}

On first launch, TRiCYCLE will ask permission to collect anonymous usage data.  This information will help us focus future development efforts, but if you prefer not to submit this data, you can decline.  You can change your mind at any time by checking or unchecking the tick box in the options dialog.

By default TRiCYCLE also periodically checks for the availability of updates on the tridas.org website.  If you would prefer to check manually you can turn this features and either use the `Check for updates' entry in the Help menu, or visit the TRiDaS website with your normal web browser.

\chapter{Help and more information}

The best place to start is through the TRiDaS website (\url{http://www.tridas.org}) and the
Dendro Data Standards forum. The forum is a email list for the discussion of TRiDaS and other dendro
data standards issues. It is open for all to join by emailing Peter Brewer (\href{mailto:p.brewer@cornell.edu}{p.brewer@cornell.edu}).

TRiCYCLE is an open source product therefore we are very pleased to welcome anyone that would
like to assist in its development. This obviously includes programmers, but also people willing to help
with documentation and translations too. To find out more information please contact Peter Brewer
(\href{mailto:p.brewer@cornell.edu}{p.brewer@cornell.edu}).

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

\begin{lstlisting}

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

                  (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or devices.
            

            2.2. Contributor Grant.

            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

      3. Distribution Obligations.
            

            3.1. Availability of Source Code.

            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
            

            3.2. Modifications.

            The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            

            3.3. Required Notices.

            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            

            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            

            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
            

            3.6. Larger Works.

            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.
            

            4.1. New Versions.

            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
            

            4.2. Effect of New Versions.

            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
            

            4.3. Modified Versions.

            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
    

      6. TERMINATION.
            

            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
            

            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
            

            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
    

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
    

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
