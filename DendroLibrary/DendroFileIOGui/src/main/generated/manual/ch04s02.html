                model. TRiDaS has a rich array of fields to represent all manor of dendro data and
                metadata. Although most of these are optional, the TRiDaS specification requires
                that a handful of these are always filled in. Unfortunately many of the legacy data
                formats do not contain information for these mandatory fields, therefore TRiCYCLE
                must fill these with default values. The metadata editor enables you to override
                these default values. </p><p> Clicking on the reader metadata editor button in the options window will give a
                table of all the metadata fields that will be set automatically by TRiCYCLE along
                with their current values. You can change most of these with the exception of those
                that are required to be a controlled vocabulary. These will require a more
                complicated interface which we haven't had time to implement yet. The third column
                in the editor is a tick box to specify whether the value is overriding or not. If
                ticked, the value specified in this editor will be used regardless of whether a
                value can be extracted by TRiCYCLE from the input datafiles. </p><p> An identical editor is available for the writer. These are the default values
                used by the writer code for your chosen output format. For instance, TRiDaS does not
                require that a start year field be set (as in the case of relatively dated series),
                whereas some output formats do require such a field. If an input file does not
                contain start year information then some writers need to know which default value
                for start year to use. Like for the input metadata editor, you can set fields to
                'overriding' which means they will be used regardless of whether this information is
                available in the input dataset. </p></div></body></html>
