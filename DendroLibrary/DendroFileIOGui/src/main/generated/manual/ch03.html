Choose your input file
            format from the pull down list on the File List page. Then select the file(s) that you'd
            like to convert by clicking on the browse button. You can add files one at a time or in
            bulk. Once you have your list of files prepared you can then go to the Convert
            tab.</p><p> On the Convert page, the next thing you need to do is select the desired output
            format from the drop down list. Next, press the convert button and after a short delay
            your files should appear in the list below. At the bottom of the window, you'll see a
            summary showing how many files were processed, how many of the convertions failed and
            how many were converted successfully but with warnings. </p><p> The results of the conversion are shown in a tree view on the convert tab. Files that
            failed to convert are highlighted by a red cross along with a message explaining what
            went wrong. Each file that convered successfully and with no warnings is shown with a
            green tick icon below which are shown the output file or files. Depending on the input
            and output formats chosen, a input file may be converted into one or more output files
            as some formats can store just one series while others can store multiple series. </p><p> If there were warnings produced during the conversion process, then the file will be
            marked with a orange exclamation icon. Warnings can be associated with either the
            process of reading the input file, or writing the output file. They can also be related
            to a single series within the file or the input file as a whole. The warning messages
            are displayed to illustrate the context of the warning. Longer warnings will scroll of
            the edge of the window, but if you hover your mouse over the warning a tooltip will show
            the entire message.</p><p>
            If you would like to preview the result of the conversion process you can
            double click on the output files and they will be displayed in a text viewer.
            This option is not, however, available for binary formats such as CATRAS and
            Excel.
        </p><p> Once you are happy with the results of the conversion you can save the files
            permanently to disk by pressing the save button. It will offer you the option of
            specifying which folder to save the files to.
