                When converting from a multi-series format to a single series format this means that
                one input file is converted to multiple output files. The naming convention is used
                to determine how to name the output files. The naming convention relates to the
                filename itself and not the file extension. The file extension is specific to the
                output format chosen (e.g. Heidelberg files are .fh and TRiDaS files are .xml). </p><p>
                </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Numerical</span></dt><dd><p>This is the default naming convention. It uses the name of the
                                input data file and appends an incrementing number if more than one
                                output file is produced.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">UUID</span></dt><dd><p>This gives all output files a random named based on Universally
                                Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). This is a 36 character hexidecimal code
                                which due to the astronomically large number of possible
                                combinations is garanteed to be universally unique. A typical
                                filename will look like:
                                550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Hierarchical</span></dt><dd><p>This uses the hierarchical structure of the TRiDaS data model to
                                provide a meaningful name for the output file. It joins together the
                                title of each entity in the file beginning with the project name
                                through to the series name. For files that contain multiple series,
                                the name will contain details of all the entities shared by all the
                                series in the file. For example, if a file contains several series
                                from the same sample, then the file name will be
                                projectTitle-objectTitle-elementTitle-sampleTitle. If the file
                                contains several series from different samples of the same object,
                                then the file would be projectTitle-objectTitle. If multiple output
                                files end up with the same name then like the numerical convention
                                described above, the files will have an incremental number appended
                                to the end. Unfortunately, most input data files do not contain rich
                                name information so files end up being called
                                unnamedProject-unnamedObject-unnamedElement etc. This convention is
                                therefore more appropriate when converting from TRiDaS to other
                                formats. </p></dd></dl></div><p>
